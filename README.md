# Sentiment_Analysis_of_Movie_Reviews
This is a machine learning model that classifies a lengthy movie review as either "Positive" or "Negative" with 90% accuracy. 

Suppose, you want to watch a movie a friend suggested in the weekend. You go to IMDb website and
look at the review of the movie. The problem is that after a long day, you don't have the patience to
read a legnthy review! Would it not be nice to just know if the review is positive or negative without
reading the whole thing?

We will try build a model that when we input a movie review, we can get an answer if it is a positive
review or a negative review.

GOAL: The task we want to solve is as follows: given a review, we want to
assign the label “positive” or “negative” based on the text content of the
review.

We will use a dataset of movie reviews from the IMDb website collected by Andrew Maas. This dataset
contains the text of the reviews, together with a label that indicates whether a review is “positive” or
“negative.” 
The training and test sets each contain 25,000 data points.
The final model makes use of about 155,000 features!
